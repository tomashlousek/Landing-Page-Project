# Landing-Page-Project
Landing page project with Foundations course from The Odin Project. My first try on designing an imaginary website.
This is my first programming project. After taking some part of Foundations course on The Odin Project, I was able to do my first page. Using HTML and CSS basics, that I've learned I managed to somewhat do it. It was tough for me, but with around 2 days of intensive programming and endless google searches, I managed to get it done. The final resault isn't perfect, but good enough for me right now, with future changes to be done. 
I must say, that I've learned a lot of things during this project, and it made me even more interested in the concepts of HTML and CSS. I will continue learning them and will add JavaScript knowledge for future projects.
Thank you for reading.
